List of todo things:
1. Change JSON documents structure:
- no mixing different languages in one document
2. Simplify the way of template content generation
- no need to include language reference - it have to be done inside controller
3. Add a example of JSON document 
- remove real data from repository
- instead push example data/structures
4. Optimize content factory
